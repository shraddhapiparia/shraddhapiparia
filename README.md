## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Shraddha, PhD in Computer Science with a postdoctoral focus in biotechnology, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP), advanced statistical modeling, and machine learning.  

My work integrates computational methods with genetic research to drive insights in bioinformatics.

Key Takeaways applicable in real life:

Bayesian thinking improves decision-making:
New evidence should refine our beliefsâ€”whether in science, career decisions, or relationships. Adaptability beats rigid thinking.

Genetics is fixed, but biology evolves:
While DNA remains constant, other 'omics' change over time, influencing both physical and mental health.

Small samples lead to big misinterpretations:
Drawing conclusions from a single study, one bad experience, or limited data can be misleading. Broad claims require diverse, representative data.

Public perception of biotech is often misaligned with data:
Fear around gene editing, AI in medicine, or vaccines stems from misinterpreted probabilities rather than actual risks.

Regression to the mean affects drug responses:
Extreme outliers in trials often revert to average responses over time. True effects require long-term validation.
